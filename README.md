# ML-techniques-study

Comparison of Artificial Neural Networks, Support Vector Machines, 
k-Nearest Neighbours and Convolutional Neural Networks to solve the 
classification problem of the EMNIST dataset. The objective is to 
classify handwritten characters as the 26 letters of the english 
alphabet.

# Instructions

The project uses the Julia language and the scikit-learn and Flux 
packages for ML.
